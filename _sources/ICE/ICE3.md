## Overview

In this ICE we will make a 4-bit ripple-carry adder.

So far in this course you have implemented individual components on your
FPGA. However, one of the benefits of VHDL is that we can pull multiple
components into a single design.

In order to organize and reuse individual components, we are introducing the concept of a **Top Level Design**.

```{important}
The Top Level is where you pull in and connect all of the different components
before finally connecting them to the IO of the board.

This is how you will manage the complexity of combining numerous components.
```

You will need to use the concept of a Top Level Design in Lab 2,
so this is directly applicable.

### Objectives

The objectives of this in-class exercise are for you to:

- Implement and test a ripple-carry adder with full adders using VDHL
- Employ a `top_level.vhd` file
- Gain more experience using tools (Git, Markdown, Xilinx Vivado)

## Background

### Full Adder

A full adder extends the half-adder to include a Carry In bit, $C_{in}$.

```{tip}
Adders are discussed on page **238** of *Digital Design and Computer Architecture, RISC-V Ed.*
```

A truth table, schematic symbol, and logic equations for a full-adder are shown below.

```{figure} img/ice3_image1.jpg
Full-adder schematic, from fig 5.3 in *DDCA*
```

$$
S = A \oplus B \oplus C_{in}
$$

$$
C_{out} = AB + AC_{in} + BC_{in}
$$

```{table} Full-adder truth table
:name: full-adder-truth
| $C_{in}$ | $A$ | $B$ |   | $C_{out}$ | $S$ |
|----------|-----|-----|---|-----------|-----|
| 0        | 0   | 0   |   | 0         | 0   |
| 0        | 0   | 1   |   | 0         | 1   |
| 0        | 1   | 0   |   | 0         | 1   |
| 0        | 1   | 1   |   | 1         | 0   |
| 1        | 0   | 0   |   | 0         | 1   |
| 1        | 0   | 1   |   | 1         | 0   |
| 1        | 1   | 0   |   | 1         | 0   |
| 1        | 1   | 1   |   | 1         | 1   |
```

### Ripple-Carry Adder

> The simplest way to build an $N$-bit carry propagate adder is to chain together $N$ full adders.

**DDCA* Figure 5.5 shows a 32-bit ripple carry adder.
```

Our goal will be to implement this in VHDL!

## The Project

### Setup Vivado

You've already cloned the repository, so you should be able to simply open the `.xpr`!

Notice that we have include a Full Adder for you. It's very similar to the Half Adder you made for ICE 2!

%% This Section should be changed to "Full Adder" next year, after modifying ICE 2
<!-- ### Import half adder

You created a half adder during [ICE2](ICE2.md). We will reuse that code here.

First, copy and past your completed the `halfAdder.vhd` file into `src/hdl/`

Then, follow the instructions in {ref}`manual-add-to-vivado-project`
to add `halfAdder.vhd` to the project as a source.
Make sure you see hallfAdder in the sources hierarchy.

The half-adder test bench has already been added for you.
We recommend you run the simulation just to verify that things
are working properly.

```{note}
Adding a file to the project will allow Vivado to see it and use it
but the file will **NOT** be automatically added if you migrate
the project to a new computer (such as with Git).

In order to do this you must {ref}`write-tcl-file`
and commit those changes as well.
You are not required to do this for the lab.
```

> Commit the addition of `halfAdder.vhd` with Git
-->

## Ripple-Carry Adder VHDL

First, open `RippleCarryAdder.dig` from your Homework.

Then, in Vivado, open `ripple_adder.vhd` and verify that the entity matches what you'd expect based on your Digital simulation.

### Declarations

#### Full Adder Component

Declare a **full_adder** component declaration to `ripple_adder.vhd` between the architecture and begin statements.

The full adder component must match the entity declaration in `full_adder.vhd`.

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of ripple_adder is

    component full_adder is
        port (
            i_A     : in std_logic;
            i_B     : in std_logic;
            i_Cin   : in std_logic;
            o_S     : out std_logic;
            o_Cout  : out std_logic
            );
        end component full_adder;
```

This is like saying "go find the entity that matches this description and get it ready to use!"

#### Signal Declaration

Remember, signals are like wires between inputs and components.

We will need the following signals:

- A carry signal to carry the ripple *between* adders.

Replace the `?` with the appropriate number (look at your Digital schematic!!) and copy this signal declaration into `ripple_adder.vhd`

```vhdl
    signal w_carry  : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(? downto 0); -- for ripple between adders
```

### Instantiations

Now that we have made the **full_adder** component available to use within **ripple_adder**
we need to instantiate multiple occurrences of the component and declare the logic to connect them
to each other and to inputs/outputs.

Remember, we are trying to build what's in your schematic, which is the 4-bit version of {numref}`ripple-carry-adder`.
Thus, we are going to use *four* Full Adders... just like in your Digital schematic!

Here are the first two instantiations of **full_adder**.
Notice that each has a unique name (because of the number at the end) and is connected slightly differently.

Copy this code into `ripple_adder.vhd` below the `begin` statement.

```vhdl
-- PORT MAPS --------------------
    full_adder_0: full_adder
    port map(
        A     => A(0),
        B     => B(0),
        Cin   => Cin,   -- Directly to input here
        S     => S(0),
        Cout  => w_carry(0)
    );

    full_adder_1: full_adder
    port map(
        A     => A(1),
        B     => B(1),
        Cin   => w_carry(0),
        S     => S(1),
        Cout  => w_carry(1)
    );
```

Then add the other two full adder instantiations.

### Ripple-Carry Test

Open `ripple_adder_tb.vhd`.
The component has already been declared and instantiated for you.

Do some quick math... how many possible inputs are there to our 4-bit adder?
More than we want to manually input! ðŸ˜„

Fill out the remainder of the test bench with a few cases. Strive for decent coverage by:

1. The min and max cases (input all zeros and all ones)
2. The easy-to-forget cases (such $0 + 0 + C_{in} = 1$)
3. A few random ones from the middle.

```{tip}
**Incremental testing** may seem slower, but it will save you time in the long run!
```

## top_basys3

```{important}
From now on, we will use a top level design file as the boundary of our system.

It allows us to connect internal components and our I/O in a reliable manner.
```

We will name the top-level file `top_basys3.vhd`... because it's the top file for our Basys 3 board!

Open that file now.

Previously, you edited `Basys3_Master.xdc` to match your entity.
Going forward, we will leave the `xdc` defaults and *only uncomment* the ports we need.
You'll find that this will reduce errors and increase reusability.

For example, our `Basys3_Master.xdc` has the following default for switches,
which we can use as a `std_logic_vector`:

```tcl
set_property PACKAGE_PIN V17 [get_ports {sw[0]}]
    set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports {sw[0]}]
```

### Entity

Our **user** will input the following on switches (`sw`):

- $C_{in}$ on switch 0
- $A$ on switches 4-1
- $B$ on switches 15-12

Our **user** will expect the following outputs on LEDs (`led`):

- $Sum$ on LED 3-0
- $C_{out} on LED 15

**Sketch this *entity* description (none of the internal workings), then**
ensure you see the following in your `top_basys3.vhd`:

```vhdl

entity top_basys3 is
    port(
        -- Switches
        sw  :   in  std_logic_vector(8 downto 0);

        -- LEDs
        led :   out std_logic_vector(15 downto 0)
    );
end top_basys3;
```

### Architecture

1. Declare a **ripple_adder** component.
2. Instantiate the *ripple_adder** component.
3. Connect the switches and LEDs appropriately.

### Test

You *could* make a `top_basys3_tb.vhd` and test it, but we've already tested
the full_adder and we wouldn't gain much more information.

Let's just move onto deploying to the board!

```{note}
If we had multiple components in our top_basys3, we should definitely make a testbench.
This is called *integration testing*, as opposed to the *unit testing* that we are currently doing.
```

## Implement Design

### Constraints File

Open `Basys3_Master.xdc`.

Because we used the appropriate naming conventions in `top_bays3.vhd` you **should not change the names!**

Simply uncomment all the `sw` and `led` lines.

### Test bitstream on FPGA

Synthesize, implement, generate.

Squirt the bitstream to the board, and be amazed!

## Deliverables

See [GitHub real fast](../appendix/github.md) if you need some tips.

### README

Take a screenshot of your **ripple_adder** waveform, save it to the root of your directory.

Make the screenshot appear in your README with the following Markdown syntax:

```markdown
![description of my waveform](imagename.png)
```

Now do the same with your sketch of the **top_basys3 entity** that you made earlier (it can be a quick and dirty picture).

Add a `## Documentation` section to the README. This is the only
one you need for the entire ICE; you don't need one in the file headers.

```markdown
## Documentation

My statement here.
```

Add the image and README.md to git and commit.

### Other files

- Run `git status`
- Double check that you have the image, your README.md and all `.vhd` and `.bit` files **committed** to your git repo.
- Then [push](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-push) them to your repo.
- Make sure all your work appears in GitHub as you expect.
- Submit the assignment on **Gradescope**.
- Make sure the autograder in Gradescope passes!

Congratulations, you have completed In Class Exercise 3!
