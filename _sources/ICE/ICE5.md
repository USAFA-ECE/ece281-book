# ICE 5: Basic Elevator Controller

```{contents}
:local:
:depth: 2
```

## Overview

In this in-class exercise, you design an elevator controller that will traverse
four floors (numbered 1 to 4).
You will only simulate your design; you will not implement it in hardware during this ICE.

### Objectives

- Create and simulate a synchronous sequential logic system
- Use VHDL to build a provided state diagram.
- Write a testbench for a synchronous system to fully simulate the state machine's operation.

### End State

Provide a demo of your waveform to your instructor.

You are not required to turn in ICE5; however,
**ensure the following files are pushed to your repository**:

1. VHDL files
2. Waveform and waveform configuration files

## System Specification

Your elevator controller will traverse four floors (numbered 1 to 4).

- Two external **inputs**, `i_up_down` and `i_stop`.
- When `i_up_down` is '1' and `i_stop` is '0', the elevator will move
    up until it reaches the top floor (one floor per clock, of course).
- When `i_up_down` is '0' and `i_stop` is '0', the elevator will move
    down until it reaches the bottom floor (one floor per clock).
- When `i_stop` is '1', the system *always* stops at the current floor.
- When the elevator is at the top floor, it will stay there until `i_up_down`
    goes to '0'.
- When the elevator is at the bottom floor, it will stay there until `i_up_down`
    goes to '1'.
- The system should **output** the floor it is on (1 - 4) as a **four-bit binary number**, `o_floor`.
- `i_reset` *synchronously* puts the FSM into state **Floor 2**.

This description is translated into a state diagram shown in {numref}`elevator_fsm`.

```yaml
Inputs:
    i_up_down : '1' is Up, '0' is Down
    i_stop    : '1' is Stop, '0' is Go

Outputs:
    o_floor:
        Floor 1: "0001"
        Floor 2: "0010"
        Floor 3: "0011"
        Floor 4: "0100"
```

## elevator_controller_fsm.vhd

The entity description has been completed for you.

### State register process

Recall that `i_reset` should be synchronous! Reference Lesson 22 Note Taker.
The reset state is **Floor 2**.

Because `i_stop` effectively functions as an *enable*, we can handle it
in our state register implementation.

Effectively, (if reset is low) then current state gets next state only when
the rising clock edge **and** the elevator is not stopped.
Otherwise, we stay at our current state (floor).

This allows us to greatly simplify our next state and output logic! See below.

### Enumerated types

This template has already been loaded with **enumerated types** for your states.

Enumerated types allow you to define your next state and output logic in terms of the state name instead of bits! This means you don't have to create the equations
for a chosen encoding type. Vivado gets to take care of that for you.

```vhdl
type sm_floor is (s_floor1, s_floor2, s_floor3, s_floor4);
```

Here we have the type `sm_floor` which can be any one of the four provided states.
We can also make signals of this type! This signal can be assigned the values
defined above.

```vhdl
signal f_Q, f_Q_next : sm_floor;
```

You can use an enumerated type for conditional assignments!
See `VHDL Reference.pdf` on Teams.

Because we handled `i_stop` in the state register (see above),
our concurrent logic here can be greatly simplified.

We provide a shell. The `< >` symbol represents a placeholder.
The `...` means you need additional lines of logic.

```vhdl
-- Next State Logic
f_Q_next <= <state> when (<condition>) else -- going up
            ...
            ...
            ... -- going down
            ...
            ... else
            ...; -- default case
```

```vhdl
-- Output logic
with f_Q select
    o_floor <= <value> when s_floor1,
            ...
            ...
            <value> when others; -- default is floor1
```

- The entity declaration has been completed for you.
- Use a **synchronous reset** for your controller FSM

```{hint}
We recommend that you handle `i_stop` logic in your **process**.
This will save you *lots* of lines in the concurrent statements.

Also, think about how nested if statements and `elsif` are helpful.
```

> Read through the provided code and comments, and then build the state machine in VHDL.

## elevator_controller_fsm_tb.vhd

We provide a component declarations, port maps, and simulated clock.
All you need to do is complete the `test_process`.

Make sure you hit:

- Reset
- Elevator going up
- Elevator going down
- Elevator waiting on floors
- Elevator stopping on top floor (while going up)
- Elevator stopping on bottom floor (while going down)

1. Add the `f_Q` and `f_Q_next` signals to your waveform.
2. Save the `.wcfg`
3. Add a screenshot to your README

> Show the waveform to your instructor.

## Deliverables

Double check that you have all VHD files and your Waveform pushed to GitHub.
The GitHub Action should run your testbench and pass.

| Deliverable           | Points |
|-----------------------|--------|
| Waveform Demo         | 50     |
| Passing GitHub Action | 50     |

Congratulations, you have completed In Class Exercise 5!
