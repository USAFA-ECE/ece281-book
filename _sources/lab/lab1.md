# Lab 1 - ThirtyOneDayMonth

Due: Lesson 11

```{contents}
:local:
:depth: 2
```

## Overview

In this lab you will design a circuit that takes a month as a 4-bit
binary input (e.g., January is equivalent to `0001` and December is
equivalent to `1100`). For each month that has 31 days, you should turn on
the red LED (your output value, $Y$, is `1`). All other months should produce an output of `0`
and unused inputs can produce an output of `X` (don't care).

You will design several prototypes, simulate *some* of those prototypes,
and then *implement* one design in hardware.

This circuit will **first** be implemented in hardware using integrated
circuits and **then** implemented in hardware using VHDL.

### Objectives

1. Design and implement a circuit in hardware using integrated circuits.
2. Design and implement a circuit in hardware using VHDL.

### Supplies

- Basys3 board

### Collaboration

- Each student must submit his or her own work to Gradescope.
- You should collaborate during the pre-lab to figure out how to do the schematics.
- The lab itself will be less collaborative, although you can always discuss general concepts with other students.
- You can never look at another student's code.
- Per the dean, a Documentation Statement is always required.

## Background

In order to represent 12 months in unsigned binary, we know we need four bits:

$$
ceiling(log_2(12)) = 4
$$

Eventually we will move to representing that with a vector, but for now let's just give each input bit a letter: $D$, $C$, $B$, $A$, from most to least significant bit.

Our output is $Y$.

- If input month has 31 days then $Y=1$
- If input month does not have 31 days then $Y=0$
- If input is not a month then $Y=X$ (don't care)

## Pre-lab

The pre-lab will be submitted to Gradescope *prior* to starting the lab.

1. Go to [https://github.com/USAFA-ECE/ece281-lab1](https://github.com/USAFA-ECE/ece281-lab1)
2. Click "Use this template" and make a repository under your GitHub account
3. Use Git Bash to clone the newly-created repository to your local machine
4. Verify that you *your* copy of the repository *not* the USAFA-ECE one

```bash
# Run this from inside your lab 1 repo
# You will have to `cd` after `git clone`
git remote -v
```

```{important}
All **prelab** work for this assignment must be committed to the `prelab/` folder.

Your instructor will not be able to see any other folders in Gradescope.
```

### Boolean Equations

```{note}
These instructions leave off file extensions.
You can use whatever you want, as long as Gradescope supports it,
but `.pdf` or `.png` is probably the best choice.
```

#### Truth Table

Create a truth table that represents the conditions described above.
Use [https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

It should have the following columns

- Month
- Input $A$
- Input $B$
- Input $C$
- Input $D$
- Output $Y$

Here are the first two rows

| Month | A | B | C | D | Y |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|
|       | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | X |
| Jan   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

```{hint}
You can think of A, B, C, D as a 4-bit vector.

In this case, A is the most significant bit (MSB)
while D is the least-significant bit (LSB).
```

Insert this truth table under the Truth Table heading in `prelab/README.md`

#### K-Map

Use a K-map to find the simplified equation for $Y$.

- Add your k-map to the repository at `prelab/kmap` (with an appropriate file extension).
Then **commit** your k-map.
- Write your simplified boolean equation under the Boolean Equation heading in `prelab/README.md`

### Draw schematics

So far with the **engineering method** we've defined the problem.
The next steps are to "collect data," "create viable solutions,"
and "analyze solutions and select the best solution."

#### Available chips

Collecting data == determining what chips we have available.

Our lab has the following [7400 series transistor-transistor logic (TTL) integrated circuits (IC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400-series_integrated_circuits)

- 74151
- 7404
- 74154
- 7432
- 7400
- 7411

These data sheets are available in Teams or can be searched online.

#### Create viable solutions

We will iterate to hone in on the best solution.

1. First we will draw designs with logic gates
2. Next we will draw some of those designs with IC schematics
3. Then we will simulate some of those designs
4. Finally, we will build one design.

#### Hand Drawn Logic Gates

Using **logic gate symbols** that correspond to the types of chips you have available
draw **four** separate schematics that can implement your truth table.
Make sure to reference data sheets for the components to ensure you
have included every input they need to function

```{tip}
It is *much* easier to draw circuits with logic gates than with IC schematics.
We are looking to *prototype so we can quickly compare alternatives.*

Even though we are being fast here, strive to be as neat as possible.
See *Digital Design and Computer Architecture* **Figure 2.23** for a great example.
```

- The first schematic will use an 8:1 MUX (74151) and inverter(s) (7404).
- The second schematic will use a 4:16 \"one-cold\" (active low output) decoder (74154), inverter(s), and two-input OR gate(s) (7432). Using 2-input NANDs (7400) is also acceptable.
- The third schematic will use only inverter(s), two-input OR gate(s), and three-input AND gate(s) (7411).
- The fourth schematic will only use NAND gates with either two or four inputs.

#### Simulated Logic Gates

Now that you have **four** prototypes to compare, we will rule out some solutions
and continue with two viable options.

Typically, this is an invovled process (often with a decions matrix!)
But four our purposes, we will pick for you.

Use [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) to simulate the following two circuits.
We give you templates in `prelab/`

- 8:1 MUX (74151) and inverter(s) (7404) --> `MUX_Logic.dig`
- Inverters, OR, AND --> `SOP_Logic.dig`

After you have working simulations, commit your changes!

#### IC Schematics

With two working simulations, it's time to decide which circuit we are actually going to build.

In Digital, simulate the a 8:1 MUX (74151) and inverter(s) (7404)
as an **IC** schematic using the `prelab/MUX_IC.dig` template.

```{Hint}
Look at the datasheet!

Some of the chips must be powered (`Vcc` or `Gnd`)
as well as enabled (see "strobe").

Pay attention to the order of the inputs to the MUX and encoder;
which bit is the MSB?

**You will build this IC on a breadboard directly off of this simulation!**

## Lab: Integrated Circuit

Using your Digital simulation of the first schematic (3.a 8:1 MUX (74151) and
inverter(s) (7404)) you will implement Thirty-One Day Month functionality
in hardware using integrated circuits.

```{tip}
Remember to avoid floating inputs, or you will spend a lot of time debugging.

All unused input pins need to be grounded (0) or connected to `Vcc` (1).
```

```{danger}
Do not connect unused **outputs** to Ground; this will cause a short and let out the magic smoke!

Power down your circuit before making any adjustments or changes!
```

Reference [](../ICE/ICE1.md) if you need a refresher on how the breadboard functions
and how to place your power converter. You can also reference the
breadboard handout in the Datasheets Library to determine how the
breadboard is connected.

Double check all connections before turning on power.

> - **Demo** your operational integrated circuit to an instructor.
> - **Commit** an image of your circuit to your git repo.

## Lab: FPGA

Now we will construct the same circuit in VHDL.

### Setup Vivado Project

Open the `.xpr` file with Vivado.

You should see the following files:

- `thirtyOneDayMonth.vhd`
- `thirtyOneDayMonth_tb.vhd`
- `Basys3Master_Lab1.xdc`

```{tip}
You can *optionally* enable GitHub Actions in your repository.
Doing so will enable your simulation to run on every **push** to the repo.

While you are also running simulations in Vivado, this will be useful because
it gives you confidence that the Gradescope autograder will be happy.

Additionally, this continual testing is a big piece of [DevOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devops/).
```

### Entity

Create your interface (ports) for the `thirtyOneDayMonth` according to {numref}`thirtyone-day-month`.

```{figure} img/lab1_image1.jpg
---
name: thirtyone-day-month
---
thirtyOneDayMonth entity with interfaces shown in blue and architecture in purple.
```

Think of this as the actual chip we used in the integrated circuit.
The internal architecture is purple. It is a cloud because we haven't
defined the circuitry inside that makes the chip
do the desired combinational logic.

The ports can be created in VHDL using the `std_logic` signal type.
Remember, `std_logic` is like a single digital logic wire.

#### Input interface

You found the logic equation during the pre-lab.
Let's map the input $A$ from that equation to `i_A` in our entity.

Recall that the `i_` prefix matches the naming convention for inputs described in the header.

```vhdl
i_A : in std_logic;
```

> Use the above syntax to create the rest of the input ports within the entity.

#### Output interface

Our pre-lab output $Y$ was a single bit; likewise, the output, `o_Y`
is a single wire, so will still be of the `std_logic` type.

```vhdl
o_Y : std_logic;
```

> Use the above syntax to create the output port within the entity.

You now have the entity portion of the thirtyOneDayMonth component
complete. Next, you need to develop the internal logic, the
architecture.

### Architecture

Now that we have our entity interfaces, it's time to describe the internal behavior of our circuit.

Create the logic to implement the internals of the thirtyOneDayMonth
entity. The logic is *described* using VHDL, but the Basys3 board will
*implement* the design using logic gates and other hardware components
similar to what is inside the chip used during the integrated circuit
portion of the lab.

As we saw in class, a multiplexer has 3 different signals: select, input,
and output. We will connect three of our entity inputs to select bits
and the fourth input bit to the input of the multiplexer. The entity
output will be used as the multiplexer output.

Since we already created the entity inputs and outputs, the only internal
signal we need to implement is the select.
This can be created using the `std_logic_vector` signal type as seen below.
This is declared *before* **begin**:

```vhdl
signal w_sel : std_logic_vector (2 downto 0); -- MUX sel
```

```{hint}
A std_logic_vector signal is a vector of std_logic signals; meaning,
you can access a wire within the vector using an index inside of parentheses.
```

> Replace the example code to include the multiplexer select signal within the architecture.

In the CONCURRENT STATEMENTS section of the architecture you will need
to connect your entity inputs to the appropriate wires of the `w_sel`
vector. The individual wires of a vector can be accessed with indexes.
To assign a value to the LSB of the vector you would do the following:

```vhdl
w_sel (0) <= i_C ; -- connect input C to the LSB of w_sel
```

> Repeat the signal assignment for `i_B` to index 1 and `i_A` to index 2.

Finally, implement your prelab design using behavioral modeling as discussed in class.

### Testbench and Simulation

The testbench will be used to simulate your entity prior to implementing
it on the Basys3 board. As you will learn, implementation takes a very
long time and simulating your solution will save you a lot of headache.

The general concept of a testbench is to include the component you
created and then test every input and observe if the output matches the
truth table designed in the prelab.

As this is the first time using a testbench, a lot is spelled out for you.
Read through the provided template to see how it was set up. In the
future you will have to write a lot of this code. There are three main
sections that are complete to pay attention to:

- **Component**: declares the component of your top-level entity (this is
    the unit under test, UUT). This section will be an exact copy of your entity.
- **Additional components**: These are internal signals used to wire your
    simulated inputs and outputs to the entity. You will typically need a
    wire that corresponds to each port of your top-level entity.
- **Port Maps**: A port map wires your internal signals to the entity. There
    should be a port map for each entity you are testing.

A 4-bit test signal vector, `w_sw`, was created for you in the Additional
components section to create your test cases. Instead of assigning each
bit of the entity (A-D), you can assign all 4 inputs at once using hex.
For example, you can use `x"1"` to represent the binary `"0001"` which
would then assign a `1` to `i_D` and a `0` to `i_A` through `i_C`. Since we are
simulating real hardware, we will have to create delays between each
change in input. We can test an input and delay for 10 ns using the
following:

```vhdl
w_sw <= x"0"; wait for 10 ns;
```

This is the first test case of our 4-bit input truth table. To finish the test process, you need to create the additional $2^4 - 1$ lines.

> Complete the test process

#### Run the simulation

After the testbench is written, under SIMULATION click **Run Simulation**.

When the waveform appears, maximize the window. Then, edit the names of the `i_sw` bits as $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, to help match the results to your truth table.

Click the `>` to expand the vector. Then right click on `[3]` and select rename.
You can then change it to `i_A`. Repeat for the other three signals.

Make sure the simulation results match your truth table.

### Constraints File

Open your Basys3Master_Lab1.xdc file.

The .xdc file maps the signals in your entity to the
physical pins on the board. This time the constraints file is complete and you will not need to make changes to it.

As an example, `i_A` is mapped to pin **V17** which is the 4th switch from the right.
The other inputs are mapped similarly.

The output, `o_Y` is mapped to pin **U16** which corresponds to the
LED on the far right.

In the future, you will have to ensure the mapping is done correctly.

### Implement

1. Generate the bitstream (.bit) file and download it to your FPGA.
2. Verify that your design functions correctly.
3. Demo your working board to your instructor.

### Deliverables

Submit the following to Gradescope Lab 1.

> - **Commit** all images, `.vhd`, `.bit`, and `.xdc` files to your repo
> - **Push** your changes to GitHub
> - **Submit** to Gradescope and verify you get full points from the autograder
