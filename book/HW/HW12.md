# HW 7 - ICE3: Full Adder

The intent of this HW is to start thinking about reusing components to make more complex things.

## Half adder, once more

In [HW 6](https://usafa-ece.github.io/ece281-book/HW/HW6.html) you previously created a half adder in Digital.

## Full adder

To make a full adder we are going to connect two half adders!

**First**, read the [ICE3 Background](https://usafa-ece.github.io/ece281-book/ICE/ICE3.html#background) section to learn what a full adder is and how to make it with two half adders.

**After** reading the background section:
1. Open Digital, then click File > New embedded Circuit
2. Instead of making a half adder all over again, go Components > Custom > halfAdder !
3. Do that again to get your second half adder.
4. Add an OR gate
5. Add inputs and outputs and give them the following **exact** labels:
    - `Cin`
    - `A`
    - `B`
    - `Cout`
    - `S`
6. Connect everything like this - but the pants are your halfAdder component, which appears as a box.

7. Start simulation and test! It should match the [full adder truth table](https://usafa-ece.github.io/ece281-book/ICE/ICE3.html#full-adder-truth).

```{tip}
In Digital go to Analysis > Analysis (or press F9) to open up a truth table!
```

8. Save your final schematic as **fullAdder.dig**

Later, when we build this in VHDL we will connect switches and LEDs to the inputs and outputs, respectively.

## Submission

Zip both halfAdder.dig and fullAdder.dig and upload to the gradescope assignment.

```{important}
You **must** use the exact label names that we specified above,
otherwise the autograder will not work.

This is actually very realistic; engineers have to design interfaces
that work with external systems according to published standards!
```
