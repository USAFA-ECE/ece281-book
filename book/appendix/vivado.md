## Create a new Vivado Project

- In "Quick Start" click **Create Project >**
- In wizard, click **Next**
- Name your project and pick a location.
    - If you cloned a repository first, pick that folder!
    - **Uncheck** "Create Project subdirectory" if you already selected a folder
- RTL Project, do not check either box
- Add Sources, click **Add Files** and pick your source VHDL files.
- **Uncheck** Copy sources into project, then click Next.
- Add Constraints, Add Files, select your `.xdc` file, then Next.
- Default Part, click **Boards** tab at the top
- Search for **Basys3** (or whatever board you are using) and select it (will highlight blue)
- Next and Finish.
- If needed, add simulation files using steps in {ref}`manual-add-to-vivado-project`

(manual-add-to-vivado-project)=
## Manually add files to Vivado Project

By convention (and for working nicely with git) we add
source files to `src/` and if it is a hardware description file then to `src/hdl/`
(there are other source files in advnaced projects that are not HDL).

Once a file is in that location, add it to a Vivado Project by:

1. On the leftmost pane (*Flow Navigator*) of Vivado,
under PROJECT MANAGER, click on **Add Sources**
2. Select the appropriate radio button.
    - "Add or create constraints" for an `.xdc` file
    - "Add or create design sources" for source file
    - "Add or create simulation sources" for a `_tb.vhd` file
3. Click on **Add Files**
4. Select your file
5. Make sure to **UNCHECK** "Copy sources into project"
6. Click Finish

You should now see the file in the Sources tab.

The VHDL module should now be listed in your Sources sub-window.
The **bolded** name is based on the entity name.

This will also make a change in your `.xpr` file that you will need to commit as well.

## Board files

If you have not already installed the board files
(should have been done as part of Lab0), do this.
It assumes Vivado is installed at the default location.

1. Close all Vivado windows
2. Navigate to `C:\Xilinx\Vivado\2018.2\data\boards\board_files\`
3. Create a directory named `basys3\C.0\`
4. Go to [XilinxBoardStore](https://github.com/Xilinx/XilinxBoardStore/tree/2018.2/boards/Digilent/basys3/C.0).
Note the tag **2018.2** should match your Vivado version.
5. Copy all four of those files (3 .xml and 1 .json) to
`C:\Xilinx\Vivado\2018.2\data\boards\board_files\basys3\C.0\`
6. Repeat for any other boards you plan to use
7. Restart your computer, just to make sure

Vivado should now be able to see the board and present it as an option
if you create a new project or modify project settings.

(write-tcl-file)=
## Write a TCL file for use with Git

In order to work more seamlessly with Git, we place all of our `.vhd` and constraint files
in `src/hdl/`. Otherwise, Vivado will place them in unexpected nested directories.

Unfortunately, when we do this, Vivado will not know where to find our files unless we
tell Vivado where they are either manually or with a TCL file using [TCL Batch Mode](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug835-vivado-tcl-commands/Tcl-Batch-Mode).

### To write a TCL file

Vivado will write the file for you **but** you need to make a few changes.

1. In Vivado **File --> Project --> Write Tcl
2. Select an output file, such as `build.tcl` in the root directory of your project
3. **Uncheck** "Copy sources to new project". You can optionally check "Write all properties"
4. If the file already exists it is ok to overwrite.
5. No need to open the file.

#### Edit TCL file to work with Git

This example assumes you named your file `build.tcl`.

##### How to use git diff

If you are working from an existing tcl file, it is easiest to work with `git diff`
to see what changed. Both options below show additions in green and deletions in red.

Either open the `build.tcl` file in VS Code and use the Source Control Changes option to view, as shown in {numref}`vivado-tcl-diff`.

```{figure} img/vivado-tcl-diff.png
---
name: vivado-tcl-diff
---
Using VS Code to view TCL diffs
```

Or from Git Bash use the command below to produce output similar to {numref}`vivado-tcl-gitdiff`

```bash
git diff build.tcl
```

```{figure} img/vivado-tcl-gitdiff.png

name: vivado-tcl-gitdiff
---
Using Git Bash to view the TCL diffs
```

##### What to actually change

In the comments, change the absolute path to a relative path.

```tcl
# CHANGE
#    "C:/Users/User.Name/vivado/bcy/ece281-lab1/src/hdl/thirtyOneDayMonth.vhd"

# TO
#    "/src/hdl/thirtyOneDayMonth.vhd"
```

Update the relative path to project files.
The `-part xc7a35tcpg236-1` refers to the Basys3 board.

```tcl
## CHANGE
# Create project
create_project ${_xil_proj_name_} ./${_xil_proj_name_} -part xc7a35tcpg236-1

## TO
# Create project - modified to have root and source match
create_project ${_xil_proj_name_} ${origin_dir}  -part xc7a35tcpg236-1

```

It is worth doing a sanity check on any other git diffs, but the rest of the file
is probably ok as is.

### To use a TCL file

1. Clone the repo
2. Open Vivado 2018.2 (but not the project)
3. From the Vivado welcome screen, select Window --> Tcl Console
4. In the tcl console at the bottom of the screen `cd` to your project directory
5. In the console enter `source <yourproject.tcl>`
6. The project should build and you should see entities populated in the Sources window

Alternatively, use a bat file such as below:

```bat
@echo off

echo Building Vivado projeect from TCL file
echo ----------------------------------------

set VivadoPath="C:\Xilinx\Vivado\2018.2\bin\vivado.bat"
:: chcek if vivado path is valid
if not exist %VivadoPath% (
    echo Vivado path is not valid
    exit /b 1
)

set TCL="build.tcl"
:: check if TCL file is valid
if not exist %TCL% (
    echo TCL file is not valid
    exit /b 1
)

:: run vivado in batch mode to build project
call %VivadoPath% -mode batch -source %TCL%

echo ----------------------------------------

:: wait for a keypress
PAUSE
```
