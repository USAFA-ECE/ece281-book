## Course Information

### Instructors

#### [Capt Brian Yarbrough](https://www.usafa.edu/facultyprofile/?smid=54059)

- Course Director
- [brian.yarbrough@afacademy.af.edu](mailto:brian.yarbrough@afacademy.af.edu)
- Office: 2F48

#### [Lt Col James Trimble](https://www.usafa.edu/facultyprofile/?smid=54055)

### Course Goals

The goal of this course is for all cadets enrolled in the course to develop the ability to understand and design combinational and sequential circuits and construct, test, and debug these circuits using schematic diagrams and hardware description languages.  Cadets shall demonstrate an understanding of basic computer architecture and how a computer executes simple programs.

### Course Objectives

Cadets shall be able to:

- Demonstrate ability to design, analyze, and implement combinational and sequential circuits using schematic diagrams.
- Demonstrate ability to design, analyze, and implement combinational and sequential circuits using a hardware description language.
- Use contemporary software tools to debug a digital system design and verify that a digital system meets defined requirements.
- Demonstrate the ability to understand and analyze a microarchitecture (datapath and control unit) to implement a simple computer architecture.
- Demonstrate the ability to properly record and report laboratory work.

### Course Texts

*Digital Design and Computer Architecture: **RISC-V Edition*** by Sarah L. Harris and David Harris.

You **must** purchase an electronic or physical copy of this book. It will be one of the best textbooks of your career,
and you will continue to reference it in other courses.
**Sharing a digital copy is illegal and a violation of the honor code.**

- [Publisher link](https://shop.elsevier.com/books/digital-design-and-computer-architecture-risc-v-edition/harris/978-0-12-820064-3)
- [Supplemental materials](https://pages.hmc.edu/harris/ddca/ddcarv.html)

Readings should be completed *prior* to class.

### Policies

All course policies are in accordance with and subject to USAFA policies.

#### Collaboration

For all assignments in this course, unless otherwise noted on the assignment, you may work with anyone.   We expect all graded work, to include code, lab notebooks, and written reports, to be in your own work. Copying another person’s work, with or without documentation, will result in NO academic credit.  Furthermore, copying without attribution is dishonorable and will be dealt with as an honor code violation.

#### Extra Instruction (EI)

Schedule EI with an instructor if you are having difficulty with the course material.  You must have read the assignment and attempted the homework before requesting EI.  You are responsible for material if you miss class, so get notes from someone in your section.  For example, you miss the lesson where the instructor announces a quiz for the next lesson or the instructor assigns homework due next lesson.  Even though you missed the lesson, you are still responsible for the quiz, homework, or any other assignments made.  It is in your best interest to check with your classmates after an absence.  After you’ve read the assignment, attempted the homework, and checked with your classmates, you may then schedule EI if you have difficulty with the material—EI is not a remedial lecture.

#### Missing Class

 You must notify your instructor **via email** of any class absence as early as possible.  You must provide a descriptive reason and SCA number, and you should describe what you will miss and how you would like to accomplish the missed work.  Be sure to check your SCA to see if instructor “notification” or “permission” is required, and whether you are allowed to miss graded events.

#### Exams

Graded Reviews and Final Exam are closed texbook, closed notes. Quizzes will be given at instructor discretion.
Testable material includes any concepts from the labs, lectures, exercises, homework, and assigned readings.
**Not all testable concepts will necessarily be covered in lectures.**

##### Missed Exams

The following policies are outlined in USAFA FOI 537-3:

- **Scheduled Absence:** If you know that you will be unable to take the GR during the scheduled GR period, you are required to inform your instructor as soon as possible before the GR and to schedule a make-up exam.
- **Unscheduled Absence:** If you miss the GR for reasons beyond your control (e.g. hospitalization, emergency leave, delayed field trip return, etc.), you must contact the course director within two working days to schedule a makeup.  Exceptions can only be granted by the Department Head.
