# Lab 2 - Seven Segment Display Decoder

Due: Lesson 17

```{contents}
:local:
:depth: 2
```

## Overview

In this lab you will implement the
[seven-segment display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display) decoder
in VHDL to display a hexadecimal digit. The hex digit will come from a
hardware-based binary to hex converter, which you will develop.

A four-bit value will be input using switches.
Upon pressing the center button, a seven-segment display will
output the correct hex digit, {numref}`hex-of-switch`

### Objectives

1. Develop a hardware-based binary to hex converter
2. Display switch value on seven-segment display

### Supplies

- Basys3 board

### Collaboration

Your instructor will inform you if you can work in pairs or not. For all assignments in this course, unless
otherwise noted on the assignment, you may work with anyone. We expect
all graded work, to include code, lab notebooks, and written reports, to
be in your own work. Copying another person's work, with or without
documentation, will result in NO academic credit. Furthermore, copying
without attribution is dishonorable and will be dealt with as an honor
code violation.

## Background

When creating simple embedded digital designs, a seven-segment display
is a common way to display numbers or simple letters to the end-user. In
this lab, you will design a seven-segment display decoder. This decoder
takes a 4-bit binary input, and produces 7 bits that indicate whether
each "segment" of the display is **on** (`0`) or **off** (`1`).

There are seven "segments" (labeled a -- g, see {numref}`7seg-label`) and one decimal point
(we will ignore the d.p. in this lab) in a seven-segment display.

```{figure} img/lab2_image2.png

name: 7seg-label
---
Labeled segments in display
```

On our Basys3 board an anode determines which of the displays are on,
while a cathodes allow you to turn on each individual segment, {numref}`7SD-anodes`

```{figure} img/lab2_image18.jpg

name: 7SD-anodes
---

```

Said differently, you disable an entire display by connecting it to power, aka `1`.

Placing a `0` on a segment will cause it to light up, while a `1` will keep the segment dark.
This is called "active low."
For example, to display the number "0", a logic `0` must be placed on segments `b`-`g`,
while segment `a` will be a logic `1`.

In this way, you can display every hexadecimal digit:
"0" - "F" as shown in {numref}`7SD-digits`

```

## Pre-lab

First, complete the truth table for converting binary inputs to a hex output on the display.

**TODO: make excel file available**

Second, use this truth table to generate logic equations for each output.

## Lab

Now that you have Boolean equations established for each of your seven
segment outputs, it is time to implement them in hardware with VHDL!

### Setup Vivado Project

Just like in previous ICEs, you will join the assignment, clone your GitHub repository,
and run `build.bat`.

Edit the file headers as necessary.

### Top-level file

The functionality we are looking for is this:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    binary([4-bit input]) --> hex[Convert to hex]
    hex --> button{Display active?}
    button --> out[Display hex output]
```

We have opted to use switches for our input and the seven segment display as our output.
A button press will activate the display.

In order to make this happen we need to use a top level design to wire our inputs and outputs
as well as some internal logic.
We will make the seven segment display an internal component - like we did with the half-adder in ICE3 -
since it is more complex and should be tested independently.

The repository you cloned and built has a top-level file already defined.
The schematic is shown in {numref}`7SD-top-level-schem`.

```{figure} img/lab2_image19.png
---
name: 7SD-top-level-schem
---
Top-level schematic
```

You need to connect your 7SD component to four physical switches (sw)
and the seven cathodes (seg) of a seven-segment display (7SD).
Also wire a push button (btnC) to activate the 7SD by sending a **low signal** to the anode.
Since the button itself is active-high, an inverter is required.

The entity is provided for you, but you must complete the architecture.

```{note}
The entity interface has been designed so that the port names match exactly
what the constraints file (`Basys3_Master.xdc`) is already using.
```

#### A note on <= vs. =>

When connecting an input to a wire, the input must be on the right side.

In the below statement, `btnC` is the input and `w_7SD_EN_n` is
the wire connecting the button to the 7SD active-low enable pin:

```vhdl
w_7SD_EN_n  <= not btnC;
```

In this case, `<=` is an **assignment statement** and connects the button to a wire.

To connect the other end of the wire and enable the (anode) pin, you have to
use a `=>` because the `=>` is used for **case statements**, **array assignments**,
and component **port mapping**.

```vhdl
an  <= (0 => w7SD_EN_n, other => '1');
```

In the above statement, the signal an is an *output*, so it must be on the left side.
We declared `an` earlier as a 4-bit vector. The right side is using the `()` aggregate operator
to concatenate bus signals; in this case, the LSB is assigned to `w&SD_EN_n`.
The keyword "others" refers to any bus signals not otherwise explicitly listed, so sets the other
three bits to `1`.

Another way to describe the above connections is as follows:

```vhdl
a(0)    <= w_7SD_EN_n;
an(1)   <= '1';
an(2)   <= '1';
an(3)   <= '1';
```

> Follow the comments in `top_basys3.vhd` to complete the architecture.

### Add VHDL template to project

For better modularity, we will implement our seven segment display decoder as a its own component.

We have provided a template file
**TODO: make template available**
<!-- <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USAFA-ECE/helloLed/main/src/hdl/Basys3_Master.xdc" download>template.vhd</a> -->

1. Save a copy of ECE_template.vhd as a file named **sevenSegDecoder.vhd** into your Lab2 `src/hdl/` folder.
2. Save a copy of ECE_template_tb.vhd as a file named **sevenSegDecoder_tb.vhd** into your Lab2 `src/hdl/ folder.
3. Add your sources to Vivado. Remember to leave "Copy sources into project" **unchecked**. See [Add source files to project](../appendix/vivado-project.md)

Edit the file headers as needed.

1. Find and replace all instances of "ECE_template" with `sevenSegDecoder`
2. Within Vivado, open one of your VHDL files and then type `CTRL+SHIFT+R` or click on Editâ†’Replace in Files
3. Fill in the find and replace text boxes as required. Make sure to check all of the sources you want to change:

![Find ECE_template and replace with sevenSegDecoder](img/lab2_image4.jpg)

In the message area (bottom of Vivado screen) click "Replace All"

![Replace All](img/lab2_image6.jpg)

### 7SD Entity

> Create your interface (ports) for your sevenSegDecoder according to {numref}`7sd-entity-arch`

```{figure}img/lab2_image9.jpg
---
name: 7sd-entity-arch
---
sevenSegDecoder entity and architecture
```

The sevenSegDecoder module entity interface is shown in blue and the architecture in purple.
The input, `i_D`, is a bus of four wires.
The output, `o_S`, is a bus of seven wires.

This can be created in VHDL by using a **std_logic_vector** signal type.
For instance, `i_D` could be created in the **port** statement with the following:

```vhdl
i_D : in std_logic_vector(3 downto 0)
```

Remember, the `i_` follows the naming convention provided in the header
that indicates the signal is an input. The statement above `3 downto 0`
indicates that BIT3 is the MSB and BIT0 is the LSB. You could easily
reverse this by swapping the locations of the two numbers.

To access each wire from the bus you created simply refer to the bit
number in parentheses. For instance, `i_D(3)` refers to the MSB of the
input, D.

### 7SD Architecture

After you have created your component interface, you need to describe
the architecture. {numref}`7sd-entity-arch` shows that the output of
the combinational logic produces a signal for each 7SD segment (`c_Sa` ...
`c_Sg`). These combinational signals (denoted by the `c_` at the
beginning) are wired to each bit of the output segment bus (`o_S`). The
bit numbers are labeled in the diagram. For instance, `BIT0` of `o_S` is
wired to `c_Sa`.

- For clarity, declare intermediate combinatorial signals (e.g., `c_Sa`) that break out output `S` and set them to a default value of `1` (off). This should be done *before* **begin**.
- There are no PORT MAPS or PROCESSES needed for this module, so you can delete those sections.
- In the CONCURRENT STATEMENTS section, map the output `S` to the signals you created above. For instance:

```vhdl
o_S(0) <= c_Sa;
```

Below this line is a work in progress

#### Behavioral vs. Structural modeling

There are two basic philosophies for modelling digital architectures:

- **structural** describes *how* the module would be composed as a hierarchy of simpler modules.
- **behavioral** describes *what* the logic does in terms of inputs and outputs.

We will be using behavioral modelling in this lab.

For instance, you could derive the simplified Boolean expression:

$$
Sa = (D3')(D2')(D1')(D0) + (D3)(D2')(D1)(D0) + (D2)(D1')(D0') + (D3)(D2)(D1')
$$

This could then be implemented *behaviorally* with the following VHDL
code:

```vhdl

```
![](img/lab2_image15.jpg){width="5.322916666666667in"
height="0.8020833333333334in"}

Notice that the logic for the intermediate signal c_Sa is described in
terms of AND, NOT, and OR gates. Also notice that the statement spans
multiple lines and is ended by a semicolon. It is helpful to break
statements like this into multiple lines so that they are easier to
read. Each implicant from the simplified Boolean expression has its own
line and is surrounded by parentheses (use SPACE to make it more
readable).

There are many ways to describe a behavioral model, however. Contrast
the above behavioral model with the following one:

![](img/lab2_image16.jpg){width="3.6770833333333335in"
height="1.0520833333333333in"}

The behavioral model describes the logic just like the truth table. In
this case, it essentially creates a lookup table (LUT) where the '1's
are identified, and everything else is '0'. Note, how using a
**std_logic_vector** for i_D allows us to compare the input to a 4-bit
hex value(denoted by the 'x') instead of comparing all of the individual
bits. This is one of the advantages of using that signal type.

Now that you have an understanding of how to implement behavioral models
in VHDL, implement all seven of your outputs.



-   Use behavioral modelling with AND, NOT, and OR gates for at least
    two of them, and use behavioral modelling with a LUT for at least
    two of them.

-   Which model method do you think is easier to use for implementing
    your outputs?

-   Implement the remaining outputs with your preferred choice.

2\. CREATE 7SD TESTBENCH AND SIMULATE

## EDIT THE VHDL TEMPLATE

a.  You can find the VHDL template files from the General Teams Channel
    under "Handouts and Resources"..

b.  If not already done, save a copy of ECE_template_tb.vhd as a file
    named **sevenSegDecoder_tb.vhd** into your Lab2 **code** folder. c.
    Edit the header as needed.
d.  If not already done, find and replace all instances of
    "ECE_template" with "sevenSegDecoder".

e.  Copy in the port information for your sevenSegDecoder componente

f.  Declare a bus (std_logic_vector) or series of signals for the switch
    inputs.

g.  Declare a signal vector to connect to the segment outputs (e.g.,
    w_seg) from your component

h.  Port map your component instance to the wires you creates for the
    switches and the 7SD segments

> â€¢ The keyword **OPEN** can be used if you prefer to not wire a port to
> something (e.g., you will read or manipulate the ports directly in
> your simulation)

i.  Create your test plan process. Remember, you can use hex values with
    busses: ![](img/lab2_image17.jpg){width="1.0479166666666666in"
    height="0.188082895888014in"} j. Fix any syntax errors, and run the
    simulation.
k.  Inputs and outputs should already be grouped, but ensure the radix
    is set to hex. Make sure the signals are in the proper order so the
    hex values make sense. This makes verification easier. If you used a
    vector, they should be.

l.  Make sure the simulation results match your Prelab truth table, and
    then **include a waveform screenshot in your report**. You may need
    to reverse the order to make your sim match (right click-\> Reverse
    Bit Order).

3\. CREATE TOP LEVEL VHDL FILE

The top level VHDL file is what connects your component to the Basys3
development board. Figure 5 below shows the top level schematic for this
lab. As can be seen in the figure, you need to connect your 7SD
component to four physical switches (sw) and the seven cathodes (seg) of
a seven-segment display (7SD). You also need to wire a push button
(btnC) up so that it can be used to activate the 7SD by sending a **low
signal** to the anode. You can see in Figure 4 that the anode determines
which of the displays are on, while the cathodes allow you to turn on
each individual segment.

![](img/lab2_image18.jpg){width="4.039027777777778in"
height="2.626388888888889in"}

> **Figure 4 -- seven segment display**

Since the button itself is active-high, an inverter is required. The
other 7SDs (display 3, 2, and 1) are disabled by connecting them to
power. Use the provided top_basys3.vhd file for a jumpstart in
implementing your top-level design. The entity is provided for you, but
you must complete the architecture. Note, the entity interface has been
designed so that the port names match exactly what the constraints file
(Basys3_Master.xdc) is already using. You simply need to uncomment the
lines in Basys3_Master.xdc that you need to use.

![](img/lab2_image19.png){width="7.490277777777778in"
height="4.4430555555555555in"}

> **Figure 5 -- Top Level Schematic**



The comments in the VHDL file provide a guide on what you need to do.
Additionally, the code that connects the push buttons to the enable
signals on the seven-segment displays has been done for you. Note, that
when connecting an input to a wire, the input must be on the right side.
For example, in the below statement, btnC is the input and w_7SD_EN_n is
the wire connecting the button to the 7SD active-low enable pin:

![](img/lab2_image21.jpg){width="1.99625in"
height="0.17708333333333334in"}

In code above, "\<=" is an assignment statement and connects the button
to a wire. On the other hand "=\>" is used for case statements, array
assignments, and component port mapping as seen below. That statement
only connects the button to a wire. To connect the other end of the wire
to the enable (anode) pin, you have to have a second statement:

![](img/lab2_image22.jpg){width="4.423611111111111in"
height="0.1986111111111111in"}

Note, in the above statement, the signal an is an *output*, so it must
be on the left side. The right side is using the () aggregate operator
to concatenate bus signals. The keyword "others" always refers to any
bus signals that are not otherwise explicitly listed. Another way to
describe the above connections is as follows:

![](img/lab2_image23.jpg){width="1.9275in"
height="0.7638888888888888in"}

4\. IMPLEMENT THE DESIGN IN HARDWARE

> a\. Take a look at the RTL schematic (In RTL Analysis in the Flow
> Navigator on the left side of the window).

-   Is this what you expect? Did vivado implement the circuit like you
    thought it would?

-   Double click on the sevenSegDecoder component. Did vivado implement
    the circuit like you thought it would? b. Generate the bitstream
    (.bit) file and download it to your FPGA.

-   Do not forget to commit the .bit file to your Git repo.

-   The default location of the file should be:
    Lab2\\Lab2.runs\\impl_1\\top_basys3.bit c. Verify that your design
    functions correctly.

-   You have to hold the center push button down for a 7SD to show your
    output.

-   The correct hex digit is shown based on the switch positions for all
    input possibilities.

### (30 PTS) REPORT (SUBMITTED VIA GRADESCOPE BY 1700 ON T17) (10 PTS) REPORT QUALITY (TEMPLATE PROVIDED)


  **Excellent**      9-10         Report is well laid out and follows provided template.
                                  All schematics are digitally generated or NEATLY hand
                                  drawn. All figures, tables, and pictures are referenced
                                  and discussed in the report. The flow of the lab should
                                  communicate the student understands what the lab was
                                  accomplishing and should describe their process from
                                  beginning to end. All schematics and other designs are
                                  updated to reflect the final product.

  **Good**           6-8          Report follows the structure dictated below. Most
                                  schematics are digitally generated or NEATLY hand drawn.
                                  Most figures and tables are referenced and discussed in
                                  the report. The flow of the lab indicates the student
                                  understands what the lab was accomplishing and loosely
                                  describes their process from beginning to end. Most
                                  schematics and other designs are updated to reflect the
                                  final product.

  **Acceptable**     3-5          All the major sections dictated below are present but
                                  there is little flow to the document. The different
                                  sections are dropped in with little discussion. Figures,
                                  tables, and pictures are present, but have little
                                  discussion. It is hard to tell what thought process the
                                  students used when developing their solution. Schematics
                                  and other designs are present, but may not have been
                                  updated to reflect the final design or may be of poor
                                  quality.

  **Unacceptable**   0-2          Lab is incomplete. Sections are completely missing or
                                  have little to no discussion. Figures, tables, and
                                  pictures are present but have little to no discussion.
                                  The student did not communicate their thought process and
                                  it is not clear how they developed their solution.
                                  Schematics and other aspects of the design were not
                                  updated at all to reflect errors or changes from the
                                  preliminary design.
