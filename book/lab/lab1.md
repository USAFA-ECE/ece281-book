# Lab 1 - ThirtyOneDayMonth

Due: Lesson 11

```{contents}
:local:
:depth: 2
```

## Overview

In this lab you will design a circuit that takes a month as a 4-bit
binary input (e.g., January is equivalent to `0001` and December is
equivalent to `1100`). For each month that has 31 days, you should turn on
the red LED (your output value, $Y$, is `1`). All other months and unused
inputs should produce an output of `0`.

This circuit will first be implemented in hardware using integrated
circuits and then implemented in hardware using VHDL.

### Objectives

1. Design and implement a circuit in hardware using integrated circuits.
2. Design and implement a circuit in hardware using VHDL.

### Supplies

- Basys3 board

### Collaboration

Your instructor will inform you if you are allowed to work in pairs or
not. For all assignments in this course, unless otherwise noted on the
assignment, you may work with anyone. We expect all graded work, to
include code, lab notebooks, and written reports, to be in your own
work. Copying another person's work, with or without documentation, will
result in NO academic credit. Furthermore, copying without attribution
is dishonorable and will be dealt with as an honor code violation.

## Background

In order to represent 12 months in unsigned binary, we know we need a four bits:

$$
ceiling(log_2(12)) = 4
$$

Eventually we will move to representing that with a vector, but for now let's just give each input bit a letter: $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, from most to least significant bit.

Our output is $Y$.

We want $Y$ to be `1` when the inputs are a month with 31 days and otherwise `0`.

## Pre-lab

Due beginning of class on lesson 10.

### Logic equation

1. Create a truth table that represents the conditions above.
2. Use a K-map to find the simplified equation for $Y$.

### Draw schematics

Using the datasheets provided via Teams, draw **four** separate schematics that can implement your truth table.
Make sure to reference data sheets for the components to ensure you
have included every input they need to function

```{Hint}
Some of the chips must be enabled (`Vcc` or `Gnd`)).
Pay attention to the order of the inputs to the MUX and encoder;
which bit is the MSB?
```

- The first schematic will use an 8:1 MUX (74151) and inverter(s) (7404).
- The second schematic will use a 4:16 \"one-cold\" (active low output) decoder (74154), inverter(s), and two-input OR gate(s) (7432). Using 2-input NANDs (7400) is also acceptable.
- The third schematic will use only inverter(s), two-input OR gate(s), and three-input AND gate(s) (7411).
- The fourth schematic will only use NAND gates with either two or four inputs.

> **[25 Points]** Submit all materials within the Gradescope assignment, Lab 1 - Prelab.

## Lab: Integrated Circuit

You will implement your first schematic (3.a 8:1 MUX (74151) and
inverter(s) (7404)) in hardware using integrated circuits.

Reference [](../ICE/ICE1.md) if you need a refresher on how the breadboard functions
and how to place your power converter. You can also reference the
breadboard handout in the Datasheets Library to determine how the
breadboard is connected.

**DO NOT** leave floating inputs or control signals unconnected.
All unused input pins need to be grounded or connected to `Vcc`.

Double check all connections before turning on power.

```{danger}
Power down your circuit before making any adjustments or changes!
```

> **[25 Points]** Demo your operational integrated circuit to an instructor.

## Lab: FPGA

Now we will construct the same circuit in VHDL.

### Setup Vivado Project

Just like in {ref}`setup-vivado-project`, join the github classroom assignment,
clone the project, and source the `build.tcl` file to setup the project.

You should see the following files:

- `thirtyOneDayMonth.vhd`
- `thirtyOneDayMonth_tb.vhd`
- `Basys3Master_Lab1.xdc`

Edit the file headers as needed, then make the initial commit.

### Entity

Create your interface (ports) for the `thirtyOneDayMonth` according to {numref}`thirtyone-day-month`.

```{figure} img/lab1_image1.jpg
---
name: thirtyone-day-month
---
thirtyOneDayMonth entity with interfaces shown in blue and architecture in purple.
```

Think of this as the actual chip we used in the integrated circuit.
The internal architecture is purple. It is a cloud because we haven't
defined the circuitry inside that makes the chip
do the desired combinational logic.

The ports can be created in VHDL using the `std_logic` signal type.
Remember, `std_logic` is like a single digital logic wire.

#### Input interface

You found the logic equation during the pre-lab.
Let's map the input $A$ from that equation to `i_A` in our entity.

Recall that the `i_` prefix matches the naming convention for inputs described in the header.

```vhdl
i_A : in std_logic;
```

> Use the above syntax to create the rest of the input ports within the entity.

#### Output interface

Our pre-lab output $Y$ was a single bit; likewise, the output, `o_Y`
is a single wire, so will still be of the `std_logic` type.

```vhdl
o_Y : std_logic;
```

> Use the above syntax to create the output port within the entity.

You now have the entity portion of the thirtyOneDayMonth component
complete. Next, you need to develop the internal logic, the
architecture.

### Architecture

Now that we have our entity interfaces, it's time to describe the internal behavior of our circuit.

Create the logic to implement the internals of the thirtyOneDayMonth
entity. The logic is *described* using VHDL, but the Basys3 board will
*implement* the design using logic gates and other hardware components
similar to what is inside the chip used during the integrated circuit
portion of the lab.

As we saw in class, a multiplexer has 3 different signals: select, input,
and output. We will connect three of our entity inputs to select bits
and the fourth input bit to the input of the multiplexer. The entity
output will be used as the multiplexer output.

Since we already created the entity inputs and outputs, the only internal
signal we need to implement is the select.
This can be created using the `std_logic_vector` signal type as seen below.
This is declared *before* **begin**:

```vhdl
signal w_sel : std_logic_vector (2 downto 0); -- MUX sel
```

```{hint}
A std_logic_vector signal is a vector of std_logic signals; meaning,
you can access a wire within the vector using an index inside of parentheses. 
```

> Replace the example code to include the multiplexer select signal within the architecture.

In the CONCURRENT STATEMENTS section of the architecture you will need
to connect your entity inputs to the appropriate wires of the `w_sel`
vector. The individual wires of a vector can be accessed with indexes.
To assign a value to the LSB of the vector you would do the following:

```vhdl
w_sel (0) <= i_D ; -- connect input D to the LSB of w_sel
```

> Repeat the signal assignment for `i_C` to index 1 and `i_B` to index 2.

Finally, implement your prelab design using behavioral modeling as discussed in class.

### Testbench and Simulation

The testbench will be used to simulate your entity prior to implementing
it on the Basys3 board. As you will learn, implementation takes a very
long time and simulating your solution will save you a lot of headache.

The general concept of a testbench is to include the component you
created and then test every input and observe if the output matches the
truth table designed in the prelab.

As this is the first time using a testbench, a lot is spelled out for you.
Read through the provided template to see how it was set up. In the
future you will have to write a lot of this code. There are three main
sections that are complete to pay attention to:

- **Component**: declares the component of your top-level entity (this is
    the unit under test, UUT). This section will be an exact copy of your entity.
- **Additional components**: These are internal signals used to wire your
    simulated inputs and outputs to the entity. You will typically need a
    wire that corresponds to each port of your top-level entity.
- **Port Maps**: A port map wires your internal signals to the entity. There
    should be a port map for each entity you are testing.

A 4-bit test signal vector, `w_sw`, was created for you in the Additional
components section to create your test cases. Instead of assigning each
bit of the entity (A-D), you can assign all 4 inputs at once using hex.
For example, you can use `x"1"` to represent the binary `"0001"` which
would then assign a `0` to `i_A` to `i_C` and a `1` to `i_D`. Since we are
simulating real hardware, we will have to create delays between each
change in input. We can test an input and delay for 10 ns using the
following:

```vhdl
w_sw <= x"0"; wait for 10 ns;
```

This is the first test case of our 4-bit input truth table. To finish the test process, you need to create the additional $2^4 - 1$ lines.

> Complete the test process

#### Run the simulation

After the testbench is written, under SIMULATION click **Run Simulation**.

When the waveform appears, maximize the window. Then, edit the names of the `i_sw` bits as $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, to help match the results to your truth table.

Click the `>` to expand the vector. Then right click on `[3]` and select rename.
You can then change it to `i_A`. Repeat for the other three signals.

Make sure the simulation results match your truth table.

> **[15 Points]** Submit your waveform screenshot as an image in the gradescope assignment, Lab1.

### Constraints File

Open your Basys3Master_Lab1.xdc file.

The .xdc file maps the signals in your entity to the
physical pins on the board. This time the constraints file is complete and you will not need to make changes to it.

As an example, `i_A` is mapped to pin **V17** which is the 4th switch from the right.
The other inputs are mapped similarly.

The output, `o_Y` is mapped to pin **U16** which corresponds to the
LED on the far right.

In the future, you will have to ensure the mapping is done correctly.

### Implement

1. Generate the bitstream (.bit) file and download it to your FPGA.
2. Verify that your design functions correctly.
