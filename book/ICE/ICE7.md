# ICE 7: RISC-V Coding

Time to get your hands dirty with RISC-V Assembly Programming!

1. Clone https://github.com/USAFA-ECE/ece281-ice7.
    You don't have to make your own copy because there is no submission for this ICE.
2. Open it in **VS Code** and install the recommended extensions
3. Complete the missing assembly, based on the comments
4. Go to **Run** > **Start Debugging**
5. Open the LED panel if it didn't automatically
6. View the registers
7. View the memory
8. Step through the program, watch the registers change and the LEDs illuminate.
