# ICE 6: Time Division Multiplexor

```{contents}
:local:
:depth: 2
```

## Overview

In this in-class exercise, you will learn how to use the Time Division
Multiplexor (TDM) by building a test bench for it and simulating. This
will be directly applicable to creating your elevator controller in
Lab4.

A TDM allows you to rapidly switch between multiple data sets. This is
especially useful when you only have one channel on which to send data
(your seven segment display for instance). The TDM operation is fairly
simple. It is driven by a clock and cycles between N different inputs
(in this case 4) continuously. Only one of the 4 inputs comes out of the
TDM at a time.

### Authorized Resources

You may seek help from any cadet or instructor, not limited to this
course, and reference any publication in its completion. Online
resources are acceptable. However, no resources containing a solution is
allowed. Your work must **always** be your own. Normal documentation of
all resources utilized is required.

### Objectives

- Understand Time Division Multiplexing
- Prepare for Lab 4

### End State

This ICE requires a Gradescope submission.

Additionally, there is a GitHub Action testbench that should pass.
Ensure your two VHDL files are pushed to your repository.

## TDM4.vhd

Again, a TDM outputs a single one of its inputs at a time based on **time**.
This is like a normal MUX, but instead of using a select signal to determine which
input becomes the output, a TDM uses time to determine which input becomes the output.

### Entity

Lets start by going through each of the signals in a TDM entity with four data sets.

```vhdl
entity TDM4 is
    generic ( constant k_width : natural  := 4); -- bits in input and output
    Port ( i_clk    : in  STD_LOGIC;
        i_reset  : in  STD_LOGIC; -- asynchronous
        i_D3     : in  STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (k_WIDTH - 1 downto 0);
        i_D2     : in  STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (k_WIDTH - 1 downto 0);
        i_D1     : in  STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (k_WIDTH - 1 downto 0);
        i_D0     : in  STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (k_WIDTH - 1 downto 0);
        o_data   : out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (k_WIDTH - 1 downto 0);
        o_sel    : out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (3 downto 0) -- selected data line (one-cold)
    );
end TDM4;
```

- `k_width` is a generic constant. A constant is a set value used
    elsewhere (like our test bench clock period). The generic
    terminology means it is a value that can be set by the user when
    they instantiate the component. We will discuss later how it impacts
    this design
- `i_clk` is an input signal which drives the TDM. You will connect
    it to your test bench's simulated clk
- `i_reset` is an input signal which resets the TDM which sets the output to `i_D0`.
- `i_D3` is the first of 4 data sets which are passed into the TDM.
    Notice that it is a vector of `(k_width -1 downto 0)`. This means if
    `k_width` is 4 then `i_D3` is a 4-bit vector from 3 downto 0.
    `k_width` then allows the user to determine how big of a vector is going to be
    passed through. We will use 4 in this example, but if you were to
    use this with your seven segment decoder you could set it to 7.
- `i_D2` is the second of 4 data sets which are passed into the TDM.
- `i_D1` is the second of 4 data sets which are passed into the TDM.
- `i_D0` is the second of 4 data sets which are passed into the TDM.
- `o_data` represents the output of the TDM. At any point in time it
    will be one of `i_D3`, `i_D2`, `i_D1`, or `i_D0`.
- `o_sel` is an output vector that tells the user which of the input
    channels has been selected. It is one cold meaning "0111" indicates
    `i_D3`, "1011" indicates `i_D2`, "1101" indicates `i_D1`, and "1110"
    indicates `i_D0`. You will not need to use this signal in this
    exercise, other than to verify it is indeed working.

```{important}
`k_width` determines **how wide** the data vectors are.

Each of the `i_Dx` signals are **what is being multiplexed**.

In this case, we have four input signals (`i_D0-3`),
each of which is `k_width := 4` bits wide.

- To add more inputs to MUX you need to add more `i_Dx` std_logic_vectors.
- To change how many bits each input transmits, you need to change `k_width`
    and the size of the declared std_logic_vectors.
```

### Architecture

We introduce a new type in the signal declaration: **unsigned**.
The unsigned type can take basic arithmetic operations, such as addition.

```vhdl
 -- 2 bit counter output to select MUX input
signal f_sel : unsigned(1 downto 0) := "00";
```

> Read the `twoBitCounter_proc` and understand the lifecycle of `f_sel`.
>
> Read the two MUXs in concurrent statements and understand what's going on.

The file is already completed for you!

## TDM4_tb.vhd

1. Use the provided `TDM4_tb.vhd` file.
2. Finish the component declaration started in the test bench.
3. Declare the required signals
    - `w_clk`, `w_reset`
    - `k_clk_period` is a constant set to 20 ns
    - `k_IO_width` is a natrual set to 4
    - `w_D3`, `w_D2`, `w_D1`, `w_D0`, and `o_data`
    - `o_sel`

4. Complete the port map
5. Finish setting up the clk process to drive the TDM.
    This should resemble the FSM test benches.

The only thing we have left is to define our input vectors.
Generally, when using the TDM these inputs will come from somewhere
else (the output of your basic elevator controller in Lab 4, for instance).

However, in this test we are going to hard code inputs.
Assign the following values to the data inputs under the comment

```vhdl
---assign the values to data inputs
w_D3 <= ...
...
```

- `i_D3` gets "1100"
- `i_D2` gets "1001"
- `i_D1` gets "0110"
- `i_D0` gets "0011"

Finally, set your simulation to run for only 160 ns and run it.
You should get a waveform that looks like {numref}`tdm_waveform`.
